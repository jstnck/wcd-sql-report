step 1: calcualte weekly gross and net revenues, and weekly costs


create a new column called week, which indicates which week of the year it is

ie.

date     , week
2017-01-01, 1
2017-01-02, 1
...
2017-01-10, 2

2017-12-31, 52




# to check:
is weekly average / by 7? if sales only happen over 5 days, maybe div by 5



# decisions -
shouod i modify columns of the original table after i import it?

or should i create views of helper tables to do the queries i want?
